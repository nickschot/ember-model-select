# Introduction

An [ember-cli](https://www.ember-cli.com) addon to provide a searchable model select box with infinite scroll support.

The addon composes [ember-power-select](https://ember-power-select.com), [ember-infinity](https://github.com/ember-infinity/ember-infinity) and [ember-concurrency](http://ember-concurrency.com) to provide an easy to use generic model select box based on ember-data models. It can be used in any place where one might want to search for models without the need for extra JavaScript code.
